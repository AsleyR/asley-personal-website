This repo holds the source code for my personal website. Feel free to use this project as inspiration if you like it enough, I don't have any problem with that.

This page is made using React typescript, and styled using tailwindCSS.

## Resume

The website allows users to download a PDF copy of a resume by clicking the `'Resume'` tab found at the header.

</div>

The resume that's used is somewhat hard-coded into the `Header.tsx` component, which can be found [here](/src/components/header/Header.tsx). Another resume can be specified by changing the value of the `resumePath` variable found at the Header component. This will make the page to start using the new resume from then on.

By default, the resume that's used is `resume-asleyrobleto.pdf`, and it can be found inside the `public` folder.

## Hosting
